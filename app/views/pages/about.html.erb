    <h4>Why Mulberry Sound?</h4>
    
    <br>
    
    <h5>(2 Samuel 5:22-25)</h5>
        
    <p>  And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
    And when David enquired of the Lord, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.
    And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the Lord go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.
    And David did so, as the Lord had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</p>
